## Can I explain what my code does?
My code creates a simple web app which helps users view Mars Rover photos based on selected dates. I uses the NASA API to fetch images and displays them in a gallery format. Key parts include:
- fetchPhotos(date): Gets photos from NASAâ€™s API.
- displayPhotos(photos, description): A per the instructions I updates the gallery with the photos and captions.

## What was my coding process?
I started by setting up the project structure, then built and tested each feature in stages. I used branches for different features (API integration, UI updates) and used Git to keep track of changes. Testing and debugging with console logs helped me catch issues early.

## What challenges did I have?
I was getting difficulty in handling API errors and displaying clear messages was challenging. I used trycatch to manage errors, and added messages to guide users when no photos were found.

## What would I do differently now?
After getting the experience, I plan the UI flow more carefully and add automated tests for my JavaScript functions to make sure everything runs smoothly.
